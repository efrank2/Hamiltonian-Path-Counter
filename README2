Counts the number of hamiltonian paths on an n x m grid starting at the top left node and ending at the bottom right node.

S - 0 - 0
|   |   |
0 - 0 - 0
|   |   |
E - 0 - 0

Path must start at S and end at E. In this 3 x 3 sample, there are 2 possible paths.

To use:
javac solver.java
java solver <grid height> <grid width>

So, for example the above 3 x 3 grid would run as java solver 3 3. A 7 x 4 would run as java solver 7 4.
For grids with more nodes than a 5 x 5 grid, you'll need to allocate more memory (~512m) with -Xmx512m.
The program runs in reasonable time on my macbook up to a 9 x 6, but requires a lot of memory. I wouldn't suggest
running grids larger than 7 x 7.
